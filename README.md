# Hexagonal Movement Test

This project was created to test hexagonal movement.
Click on the buttons on the lower part to add/remove actors and obstacles.
Click on the actor (green tiles) to show range of movement (blue tiles) (click on it again to cancel action).
Click on any tile covered by the range to move the actor.
Obstacles (red tiles) must obstruct movement and be unmovable.
