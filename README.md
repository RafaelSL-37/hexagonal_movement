# Hexagonal Movement Test

This project was created to test hexagonal movement.
Click on the buttons on the lower part to add/remove actors and obstacles.
Click on the actor (green tiles) to show range of movement (blue tiles) (click on it again to cancel action).
Click on any tile covered by the range to move the actor.
Obstacles (red tiles) must obstruct movement and be unmovable.

I am aware that it could have a few quality of life changes, like the states not changing after just one adition to the grid.
This could lead to a lot of time spent in redesigning how the grid works, since this is a problem with useState() of arrays.
